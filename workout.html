					<span class="padded-dropcap">W</span>hat are the odds that a person who is such a strong advocate of health and fitness was never initially passionate about it ? Well, you have just met someone satisfying this condition !!  Like many other kids, I was drawn towards the colourful posters of movies (read ‘Bollywood movies’; Google the term to know more) showing male protagonists flaunting their muscles and my female friends going gaga over them. I remember being naïve enough to paste a close-up face of mine over the protagonist’s face on the poster of one such movie . LONG LIVE ADOLESCENCE !! <br/>Quite a few springs came and went by, but the image of the protagonist on the movie poster still remained etched in my mind. Finally, when I could not take it any longer, I went and enrolled myself in my local gym. Listening to my goal, the fitness trainer nodded disapprovingly, and gave a verdict that I needed to lose my belly fat before I could gain muscle. “I can’t believe this douche bag just said that !!” was my immediate thought. Nevertheless, I started my training the next day under his supervision, and spent all the time doing cardio and free-hand exercises. The 20-year old kid in me got disgusted with this ordeal after 15 days, and I stopped going. But by that time, I had received my share of body-shaming at the gym from some of the other members and most unfortunately, from the trainer himself. I felt devastated from within. I had always been the “skinny fat” kind of guy, with the fat being deposited only around my midsection or the tummy region. THE BLESSING OF BEING A SINGLE CHILD IN A MIDDLE-CLASS BENGALI FAMILY !!!<br/>About two or three years later, I came across another gym. Haunted by my previous experience, I still took the chance and went and talked to the trainer, and for the first time, I felt someone is talking sense. Sudip da, as I used to call him, made me understand for the first time, the interplay among diet, exercise and your end results, with diet being the contributor upto 70%. I came to understand the importance of compound movement exercises (exercises involving more than one muscle group, like squats, deadlifts and so on). For the first time, I actually saw some muscle gains and got complimented by my friends and especially, my skeptical girl-friend of the time (I was on cloud nine that day). However, as most of you know, getting a good physique and maintaining it require planned diet. I had always been a lazy bum in matters of cooking (I still am), and one day, my mom (who used to do all the cooking for me), revolted. “Either you stop this or look after yourself !! I can no longer go about cooking separate meals for you all day long.”  To add to that, Sudip da got a job to be a trainer at Golds’ Gym, Kolkata. I used to call it “the rich kids’ fitness center”So, RIP MY SHREDDED PHYSIQUE !!<br/>Fast forward to 2018. I had given up all exercising and was eating to my heart’s content. All my friends who knew me pre-marriage were aware of the drastic changes (in a good way) in my lunch menu after my marriage. The obvious result was a big pot-belly (fat around the midsection). I weighed 69Kg with a 35% body fat. I was low in energy, and used to doze off every evening after coming home from a grueling day at the lab. I knew I had to do something about it, but was being lazy. One fine morning, I woke up, and made a decision. I decided to change. To change my body, the first thing I needed to change was my mind. I started following a calorie deficit diet plan along with strength training and high intensity cardio. I lured my wife to join the regime with me. After a month on this regime, there was a distinct change in the way my body looked. My body fat percentage went down, I felt more energetic and did not feel like running away looking at the mirror. I then went for the kill, shifting to a keto diet regime for the next 2 months. In between, we had the Durga Puja (a very popular Fall festival for us). Amidst all the delicious foods being served there, we were the only odd ones out. We had cooked our keto foods at home and ate it there sitting in the car without anybody noticing. After these 3 months of sacrifice and hard work, my body fat went down to 12% and I lost 12Kg of bodyweight. That told me it was time to shift to the gaining phase. The picture on the right below was taken 1 month into the gaining phase.<br/><br/>
					<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="./img/portfolio/my_story_img2.jpg" alt="" style="max-height: 450px">
					In the meantime, I felt this overburning urge in myself to help people, because I was getting frustrated looking at the sorry state of affairs in the fitness industry and with the lack of scientific knowledge people have on these aspects. I realized that one can only be healthy through a combination of diet, exercise and improving your brain health.This got me into more researching and I studied and got myself certified as a Personal Trainer under the National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM) with a specialization in Fitness Nutrition. I also received certicifications as a Sleep Science, Brain Fitness and Stress Management Coach. This enables me to help you with a well-rounded approach so that I can make you become better versions of yourselves.<br/>GOOD LUCK ON YOUR FITNESS JOURNEY !!!
